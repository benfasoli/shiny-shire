- An online form must be submitted with your request and mole fraction per tank request.
- CO2 tanks can be filled and calibrated in the range of 300 to 800 ppm.
- The number of cylinders requested must be equivalent to those returned empty.
- The target CO2 is usually within 5 umol/mol near ambient concentration. Values will vary at either end of the range as well as with the addition of another gas like methane.
- Turnaround time for CO2 cylinder fills and calibration is 4 to 6 weeks. Cylinders with CO2 and CH4 may require additional time for filling and calibration. Please consider this lead-time when making request for tank fills.
- Questions can be sent to [Maria Garcia](mailto:mag10@utah.edu).
