The wireless dashboard allows the operator to control onboard valves and pumps, take geolocated notes and flask observations, access in-depth documentation for diagnosing problems with instruments or control systems, and monitor any of the 60+ simultaneous measurements from the six instruments in real-time. While convenient for the operator, this system has the added benefit of lowering the level of technical expertise required to operate the Nerdmobile allowing for the Nerdmobile to be utilized as a learning laboratory to engage students in research.
